# my-arduino-uno-shield-design

This is my first repository and my own project in designing an Arduino UNO Shield using Altium 365 Designer Professional.
First of all, I took an interest in PCB designing. At this time writing it, I am an intermediate in PCB Deisgning; I have read few books, and took courses from people like Robert Feranec, Dr. Phil, etc.
I learnt many important lesson in creating this design. Things as simple as routing Power Nets, Wiring components, Creating complete circuits, Grounding, Input-Outputting, etc. In the PCB making I've learnt more than that, which includes polygon pouring, design rules, wiring, via stitches, transitioning between layers using via, placing components, adding 3D Component Designs, Laying out the PCB Board using the Keep-out layers, Fixing multiple errors in design rule checks etc. More than that I've also learnt to output manufacturing files to order to the jlcpb standard whcich includes the BOM, Job files, Gerber files.
